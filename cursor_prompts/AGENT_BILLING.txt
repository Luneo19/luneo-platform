AGENT_BILLING — Stripe & usage billing

Tâches:

1. Implement usage billing: per-render credits, monthly plans in @luneo/billing-plans

2. Ensure Stripe webhook handler exists and is idempotent.

3. Add endpoint to query usage per tenant and trigger soft-limit enforcement.

4. Add admin UI pages to view per-tenant cost and disable heavy features if unpaid.

Deliverables:

- Usage accounting, Stripe webhooks idempotency, admin UI stubs.

Risk:

- Billing disputes: keep audit logs of render requests with costs.
