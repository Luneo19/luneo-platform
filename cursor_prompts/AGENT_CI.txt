AGENT_CI — GitHub Actions & quality gates

Tâches:

1. Add/ensure .github/workflows/ci.yml has steps:

   - install pnpm, install deps, lint, typecheck, build, unit tests, e2e smoke, zap baseline

2. Add branch protection rules recommendations in docs.

3. Add per-package test scripts in package.json workspaces if missing.

4. Add pre-commit hook template (husky) for lint-staged.

Deliverables:

- CI config, pre-commit template, workflow improvements.

Risk:

- Long CI time: split tests into fast smoke vs full pipelines (PR vs nightly).
