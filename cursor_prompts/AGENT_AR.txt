AGENT_AR — GLTF->USDZ conversion & WebXR

Tâches:

1. Create converter service/container (tools/usdz-converter) that:

   - accepts GLB + textures, optimizes textures (mipmaps, resize), outputs USDZ

   - uses gltf-pipeline + usdz-converter binary or Python tool

2. Add endpoint GET /api/designs/:id/ar that triggers conversion and returns signed CDN URL (short expiry)

3. Add frontend AR viewer: open QuickLook for iOS (rel="ar") and WebXR for supporting Android browsers

4. Add caching for converted USDZ per texture hash to avoid repeated conversions.

Deliverables:

- Converter container, API endpoint, AR frontend component, caching.

Risk:

- Device differences; require manual QA on iPhone models.
