AGENT_COMPLIANCE — GDPR & data controls

Tâches:

1. Add export & delete endpoints for user data (per GDPR):

   - POST /api/data/export?userId=

   - DELETE /api/data/erase?userId=

2. Ensure logs do not contain PII; implement log scrubbing utility.

3. Document retention policies and data lifecycle under docs/compliance.md.

4. Add e2e test for export/delete.

Deliverables:

- Endpoints, documentation, tests.

Risk:

- Partial deletes across backups; include runbook.
