AGENT_3D — Selection tool (raycast) & UV mask generation

Tâches:

1. Add SelectionTool component at apps/frontend/src/components/3d/SelectionTool.tsx:

   - react-three-fiber: raycast picking + paint brush to mark faces

   - export mask PNG with same resolution as current texture

   - produce metadata: uvBBox, selectedFaceIndices

2. Add server endpoint POST /api/designs/:id/masks to accept mask PNG and metadata:

   - validate JWT, check size limits, store to S3 or Cloudinary

3. Add back-end utility to reproject mask onto model UVs (server-side correction)

4. Add Playwright e2e test that simulates selection and upload.

Deliverables:

- SelectionTool, mask API, server reprojector, tests.

Risk:

- UV mismatches: provide fallback reprojection and user prompt.
