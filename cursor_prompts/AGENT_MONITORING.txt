AGENT_MONITORING — Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry integration

Tâches:

1. Add Prometheus instrumentation to:

   - worker queue time, openai request duration, render durations, embed handshake failures, ar conversion time

2. Add Grafana dashboard JSON skeleton under monitoring/grafana/

3. Confirm Sentry integration for backend + worker + frontend (source maps)

4. Add alerts: queue_time>60s, error_rate>1% 5m, cost_spike > 2x baseline.

Deliverables:

- Instrumentation snippets, dashboard skeleton, alert rules.

Risk:

- Too many metrics: focus on key KPIs.
