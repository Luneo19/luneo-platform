AGENT_REFACTOR — Cleanup & tech debt

Tâches:

1. Scan repo for: unused imports, any `any` types, large bundles, duplicated code.

2. Propose safe refactors: split giant modules, extract shared utils into @luneo/* packages.

3. Create PRs with limited scope and tests for each refactor (max 200 lines).

4. Add metrics on technical debt changes in PR description.

Deliverables:

- Refactor PRs, roadmap for debt cleanup.

Risk:

- Breaking changes: keep changes small and covered by tests.
