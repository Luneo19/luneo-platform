AGENT_SHOPIFY — Shopify onboarding, OAuth, webhooks, Prisma migration

Tâches:

1. Create Prisma migration for ShopifyInstall table:

   fields: id, shopDomain, accessToken, webhookSecret, installedAt, scopes, status, brandId (FK)

2. Implement NestJS module at apps/backend/src/modules/ecommerce/shopify:

   - Controller: GET /api/shopify/install -> redirect to Shopify OAuth install URL

   - Controller: GET /api/shopify/callback -> exchange code, store tokens, enable webhooks

   - Controller: POST /api/shopify/webhooks/products -> verify HMAC and process product updates

3. Add service ShopifyService to manage installs and signature verification.

4. Add sample app block snippet at apps/shopify/snippets/widget-inject.liquid:

   - Loads CDN script with data-shop attribute and signed nonce parameter

5. Add unit tests for HMAC verification and integration tests mocking OAuth exchange.

6. Add docs/apps/shopify/README.md with env vars required.

Safety:

- Use HMAC verify, replay protection, store webhookSecret encrypted.

- Validate scopes before install.
