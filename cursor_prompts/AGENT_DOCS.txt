AGENT_DOCS — Architecture docs & READMEs

Tâches:

1. Generate or update README.md for each module created/modified.

2. Create ARCHITECTURE.md top-level that diagrams:

   - Shopify install flow

   - Widget handshake flow

   - Worker render pipeline

   - AR conversion flow

3. Generate runbooks for common ops: deploy worker, convert AR, rollback DB migration.

4. Add quickstart for dev: make setup, make dev, make build.

Deliverables:

- Readmes, architecture diagrams (mermaid), runbooks.

Risk:

- Outdated docs: include last-updated header.
