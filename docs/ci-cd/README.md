# CI/CD Documentation

This directory holds CI/CD pipeline documentation for the Luneo platform.

- **CI_CD_AUDIT.md** – Pipeline audit and improvement plan
- **CI_CD_GUIDE.md** – Full pipeline guide (jobs, cache, security)
- **CI_CD_IMPROVEMENTS.md** – Applied optimizations and remaining work

Workflows live in [`.github/workflows/`](../../.github/workflows/); the main pipeline is `ci.yml`.
